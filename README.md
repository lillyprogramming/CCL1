# Lucky_Day
A game in JS, HTML, and CSS.

You want to bake a chocolate cake, but don't have any of the ingredients for it. Luckily for you, ingredients start falling from the sky. Using the "A" and "D" keys to move, gather 20 ingredients, while avoiding the non-edible items. Also, you despise food waste, so you can only miss up to 5 ingredients, but collecting the falling "cake" slices gives you lives.
