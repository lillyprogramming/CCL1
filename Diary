- Yesterday, I made the item generator and the different items: bad guys (for now triangles) and good guys (for now circles). There is a 1 in 3 random chance that a generated item will be a triangle and 2 in 3 chance that it'll be a circle. Today, I worked some more on that. I also added a start screen and play button, a Game Over screen, and a win game screen. I worked on the game over and game won conditions and I fixed some issues that I had with the collision.
